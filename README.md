    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;I decided to make a more simplistic and clean design for my website, as Amazon has a very simple and effective website and I took inspiration from them. I succeeded in turning my website into a reality as my colors and layouts are very similar. </p>
    <p class="text_column">I enjoyed a lot in HTML because I learned a lot about coding and all of the complexity seems to be gone and I understand a lot more about it. Yes I see myself doing this in the future as technologies evolve I would like to keep up. The most challenging part of the websites were the images as the resolutions werenâ€™t perfect and Im often had to fix it. </p>
    <p class="text_column">I was never able to figure out how to add boxes around the text and little designs that would fix the screen when it became too empty. No I would not see myself becoming a front end developer as even though I did enjoy this process, it was stil;l a bit tedious and there's way too much memorization. </p>
